# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction  

### 🧠 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer will discontinue the service (churn) based on their demographic details, service usage, and billing information.  
By identifying potential churners early, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve business outcomes.  

---

## 🧾 Problem Statement  
Customer churn is when a customer stops using a company’s product or service.  
The goal of this project is to **build a machine learning model** that predicts the likelihood of customer churn and identifies key factors influencing it.

**Input:** Customer details like contract type, payment method, tenure, and charges.  
**Output:** Whether the customer is likely to churn (`Yes` / `No`).
